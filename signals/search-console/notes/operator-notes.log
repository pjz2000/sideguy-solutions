Source: Google Search Console → Performance → Search results

Focus on:

1. High impressions + low CTR
   → Search intent mismatch
   → Confusion, not failure

2. Queries with clicks but no clear CTA fit
   → Human clarity opportunity

3. Queries that feel emotional, unsure, or hesitant
   → These are SideGuy-native searches

4. Queries you did NOT intentionally target
   → These are future authority pages

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT optimize blindly
- Do NOT chase CTR
- Interpret like a human who was confused
