# SideGuy PPC Signal Doctrine

Traffic is NOT signal.
Clicks are NOT intent.

Signal exists ONLY when:
- A human pauses
- A human reads
- A human reacts
- A human reaches out

Promotion is earned by clarity, not CTR.

Order of operations:
1. Calm the click
2. Confirm expectation
3. Reduce pressure
4. Invite human conversation
5. Observe reactions
6. Promote selectively
