<h1>What Are Pay-Per-Use Agent Payments?</h1>

<p>Pay-per-use agent payments are a way to pay for work only when it actually runs. There are no retainers and no monthly guessing. If a task doesn’t run, nothing is charged.</p>

<h2>What problem this solves</h2>
<p>Many businesses pay for software whether they use it or not. Pay-per-use models reduce waste by tying cost directly to completed work.</p>

<h2>How this usually works</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A task is triggered intentionally</li>
  <li>An agent performs the defined work</li>
  <li>Payment happens only after completion</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where humans stay involved</h2>
<p>Humans define the rules, approve outcomes, and step in when judgment matters.</p>

<h2>When this makes sense</h2>
<p>Irregular work, one-off jobs, and tasks with clear completion points.</p>

<h2>When it does not</h2>
<p>Constant workloads or work that requires continuous human trust.</p>
