<h1>Situations We Help With</h1>

<p>SideGuy exists for moments when something feels off and you’re not sure what the smart next step is.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Something broke and I don’t know who to call</li>
  <li>I’m about to spend money and feel uneasy</li>
  <li>A vendor sounds confident but I don’t trust it yet</li>
  <li>AI or software is being pushed on me and I don’t understand the downside</li>
  <li>Payments feel wrong but I don’t know the alternative</li>
  <li>I want a second opinion before committing</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re here, Google did its job. A human can help finish it.</p>
