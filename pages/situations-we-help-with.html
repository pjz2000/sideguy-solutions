<h1>Situations We Help With</h1>



<p>SideGuy exists for moments when something feels off and you’re not sure what the smart next step is.</p>



<ul>

  <li>Something broke and I don’t know who to call</li>

  <li>I’m about to spend money and feel uneasy</li>

  <li>A vendor sounds confident but I don’t trust it yet</li>

  <li>AI or software is being pushed on me and I don’t understand the downside</li>

  <li>Stripe / payments feel wrong but I don’t know the alternative</li>

  <li>I just want a second opinion before committing</li>

</ul>



<p>If you’re here, it means Google did its job — now a human can help finish the job.</p>



<p><strong>Real person. No bots. No pressure.</strong></p>
