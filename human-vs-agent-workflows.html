<h1>Human vs Agent Workflows</h1>

<p>The best systems combine humans and agents instead of replacing one with the other.</p>

<h2>What problem this solves</h2>
<p>Over-automation often removes accountability.</p>

<h2>How responsibilities are split</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Agents handle repeatable tasks</li>
  <li>Humans handle judgment and exceptions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where humans stay involved</h2>
<p>Approval, escalation, and decision-making.</p>

<h2>When this model makes sense</h2>
<p>Operational work with clear boundaries.</p>

<h2>When it does not</h2>
<p>Work that depends on trust or nuance.</p>
