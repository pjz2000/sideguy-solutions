# Do I Really Need This Software?

## Short Answer
You probably don’t need to rush. The right move depends on **actual problem definition**.

## What’s Going On
Most people hit this question right before money moves.

## What People Get Wrong
Urgency, sales framing, and irreversible commitments.

## The Real Goal
Less regret, fewer mistakes, and confidence.

## When Waiting Is Smart
If nothing breaks by waiting, wait.

## When a Human Helps
When the decision feels heavier than it should.
