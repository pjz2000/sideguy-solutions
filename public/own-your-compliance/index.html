<h1>Own Your Compliance Software</h1>

<p><strong>Compliance software is not magic.</strong></p>

<p>It is rules, documentation, evidence, and repeatable processes.</p>

<p>If businesses can now own their payment rails, they can own their compliance systems too.</p>

<h2>The Problem With Renting Compliance</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Annual licenses ($5k–$100k+)</li>
  <li>Your data locked inside vendor platforms</li>
  <li>No equity, no leverage, no reuse</li>
  <li>Rising costs as regulations expand</li>
</ul>

<h2>The SideGuy Perspective</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Compliance is a system, not a subscription</li>
  <li>AI can generate policies, checklists, and evidence</li>
  <li>Rules can be versioned, timestamped, and audited</li>
  <li>You should own the logic and artifacts</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Clarity before cost.</strong></p>

<p>This isn’t about skipping compliance.  
It’s about understanding what you’re actually paying for.</p>
