<h1>Why Own Compliance Instead of Licensing It</h1>

<p>Most compliance software does not create compliance.</p>

<p>It creates organization and reporting.</p>

<p>With modern tooling, AI, and clear process design, businesses can own their compliance systems the same way they now own payment infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>Compliance is a process, not a product.</strong></p>

<p>This page exists to help you understand the tradeoffs — not to sell you anything.</p>
