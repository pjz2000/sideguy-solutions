<h1>common compliance mistakes</h1>

<p>Most compliance failures are not caused by negligence.</p>

<p>They usually come from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unclear ownership</li>
  <li>Stale evidence</li>
  <li>Tool reliance without understanding</li>
</ul>

<p>Compliance software rarely fails.</p>
<p><strong>Context and judgment fail.</strong></p>

<p>This page exists to explain what usually goes wrong — and how teams avoid repeating it.</p>
