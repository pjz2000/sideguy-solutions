<h1>Money & Payment Clarity</h1>

<p>
SideGuy is where Google discovers the problem,
AI explains it clearly,
and a real human helps you decide what to do next.
</p>

<p>If you’re asking <strong>is-my-cash-flow-being-hurt</strong>, you’re not missing something.
Payments are complex by design, not because you’re doing it wrong.</p>

<ul>
<li>AI explains how money actually moves</li>
<li>Tradeoffs are shown plainly</li>
<li>A human helps you decide what (if anything) to change</li>
</ul>

<h2>Clarity Before Cost</h2>
