<h1>Should You Own Your Compliance System?</h1>

<p>This page is not advocating against SaaS.</p>

<p>It exists to help you understand tradeoffs.</p>

<h2>Renting Works When</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Speed matters more than control</li>
  <li>Compliance scope is narrow</li>
</ul>

<h2>Owning Is Considered When</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cost compounds year over year</li>
  <li>Logic is reused across teams</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Neither approach is wrong.</strong></p>
