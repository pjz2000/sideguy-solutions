<h1>what does compliance software actually do</h1>

<p>This is a real question people ask.</p>

<p>The honest answer is:</p>

<p><strong>Compliance software helps organize compliance.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It does not transfer responsibility.</strong></p>

<p>The business owner is still accountable.</p>

<p>That is why understanding the system matters more than the tool.</p>
