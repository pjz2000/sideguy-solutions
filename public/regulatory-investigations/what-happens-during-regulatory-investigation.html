<h1>what happens during regulatory investigation</h1>

<p>Investigations are rarely sudden.</p>

<p>They typically follow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ignored warnings</li>
  <li>Repeat incidents</li>
  <li>Unresolved failures</li>
</ul>

<p>During investigations, regulators focus on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Decision history</li>
  <li>Responsiveness</li>
  <li>Remediation effort</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Compliance is evaluated as a behavior, not a tool.</strong></p>
