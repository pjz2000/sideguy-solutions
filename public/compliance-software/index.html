<h1>Compliance Software — Explained</h1>

<p><strong>This page is not selling software.</strong></p>

<p>It exists to explain what compliance software actually does, what it costs, and when it may make sense to own your compliance systems instead of renting them.</p>

<h2>What Most Compliance Software Really Is</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Rules & checklists</li>
  <li>Document storage</li>
  <li>Task tracking</li>
  <li>Audit trails</li>
</ul>

<p>These are systems — not magic.</p>

<h2>Renting vs Owning Compliance</h2>
<p>For some businesses, SaaS compliance tools are perfectly fine.</p>
<p>For others, owning compliance logic reduces cost, increases control, and compounds over time.</p>

<p><strong>Clarity before cost.</strong></p>
