<h1>iso 27001 non compliance</h1>

<p>Compliance penalties are rarely about missing paperwork.</p>

<p>They usually involve:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Repeated control failures</li>
  <li>Ignored warnings</li>
  <li>Unclear accountability</li>
  <li>Poor remediation</li>
</ul>

<p>Software does not absorb liability.</p>
<p><strong>The organization remains responsible.</strong></p>

<p>This page explains what penalties actually signal — not fear tactics.</p>
