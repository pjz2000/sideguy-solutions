<h1>ai driven compliance systems</h1>

<p><strong>Compliance-as-Code</strong> means treating compliance as logic, not screenshots.</p>

<p>Instead of logging into software, businesses define:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Controls as rules</li>
  <li>Evidence as data</li>
  <li>Audits as timelines</li>
</ul>

<p>AI makes this practical for small and mid-sized teams.</p>

<p>This does not replace lawyers or auditors.</p>
<p>It replaces spreadsheets, checklists, and vendor lock-in.</p>

<h2>How This Connects to Ownership</h2>
<p>Compliance-as-Code is usually owned, versioned, and reusable.</p>

<p><strong>That is why ownership becomes a real option.</strong></p>
