  <p>

    This page exists to explain <em>ev vs vibes</em> using real-world market behavior,

    not predictions, hype, or gambling culture.

  </p>



  <h2>What most people get wrong</h2>

  <p>

    Most people chase outcomes. Markets price behavior.

    The gap between those two things is where signal lives.

  </p>



  <h2>How SideGuy looks at it</h2>

  <ul>

    <li>AI identifies mispricing</li>

    <li>Human validates context</li>

    <li>No forced action</li>

    <li>Small edges only</li>

  </ul>



  <h2>Why this matters</h2>

  <p>

    In fast-moving markets, clarity beats speed.

    This is the same principle used in soundchecks, systems engineering,

    and capital preservation.

  </p>
