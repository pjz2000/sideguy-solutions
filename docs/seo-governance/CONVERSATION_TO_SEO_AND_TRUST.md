# SideGuy — Conversation → SEO Auto-Draft & Trust Index System

This document defines how **real human questions** become **draft SEO pages**,  
how those pages are **aligned to intent**, and how **trust is protected over time**.

Nothing here auto-publishes.  
Humans always approve.

---

## Core Principle
- We do not invent keywords  
- Humans ask, pages follow  
- Real language beats SEO language  

---

## What Triggers an Auto-Draft
A draft is allowed ONLY when one of the following occurs:

- Same question asked 2+ times  
- One question with strong emotion  
- A question Google answers poorly  
- A misunderstanding that leads to regret  

---

## Approved Input Sources
- Text PJ conversations  
- Emails  
- DMs  
- Verbatim phrasing only (no paraphrasing)

---

## CPU GPT Task When Triggered
1. Capture the question **exactly as written**  
2. Remove names / personal data  
3. Rewrite as a plain-English page title  
4. Assign it to the correct library  
5. Draft the page — **do NOT publish**

---

## Approved Page Title Formats
- “Do I really need ___?”  
- “Why is ___ so confusing?”  
- “Is ___ worth it in San Diego?”  
- “What happens if I do nothing about ___?”  
- “When ___ is a waste of money”  
- “Who actually benefits from ___?”

---

## Draft Content Rules (Mandatory)
- Open with the real human question  
- Acknowledge uncertainty  
- Explain tradeoffs  
- Include a **do nothing** option  
- Avoid solutions until clarity is earned  

---

## What Auto-Drafts Must NOT Do
- Must NOT sell  
- Must NOT include pricing  
- Must NOT imply urgency  
- Must NOT imply endorsement  

---

## Human Review Checkpoint
Before anything ships, ask:

- Does this reflect the original question?
- Does this reduce anxiety?
- Does this prevent regret?
- Is this useful even if no one buys anything?

---

## If Approved
- Move draft into `seo/pages/`
- Add natural internal links
- Add **Text PJ** soft CTA
- Log the source conversation

## If Not Approved
- Store the draft
- Wait for more signal
- Never force publication

---

# Page Expectation Alignment Engine

## Core Insight
- Every click carries an expectation
- Most pages fail in the first 5 seconds
- Alignment beats persuasion

### First 5 Seconds Rule
The opening must answer:

**“Yes — this page understands why you clicked.”**

Never open with:
- Definitions
- Marketing language
- Assumptions about buying

---

## Approved Opening Templates
- “If you’re here because ___, you’re not alone.”
- “Most people land here because they’re trying to decide ___.”
- “This page is for people wondering whether ___ actually makes sense.”
- “You probably searched this because something feels off.”

---

## Structural Flow After Alignment
1. Expectation confirmation  
2. Why this is confusing (Google gap)  
3. Tradeoffs  
4. When NOT to act  
5. Calm next step (Text PJ)

---

# Text PJ Signal Capture (Locked)

## Text PJ Is:
- Not sales  
- No obligation  
- A human thinking partner  

### Approved Copy
- “Not sure what to do next? Text PJ.”
- “If this feels confusing, text PJ and we’ll think it through.”
- “You don’t have to decide today — text PJ if you want clarity.”

### Anti-Sales Rules
- Never say book / schedule / consultation
- Never imply urgency or scarcity

---

## What Text PJ Is For
- Clarifying the real question
- Helping someone decide if they need help at all
- Saying NO when appropriate
- Logging confusion patterns

---

# Trust Index Engine (Internal)

Every page is scored 0–100.

## Scoring Categories
1. Intent alignment (0–20)
2. Clarity & honesty (0–20)
3. Anti-sales integrity (0–15)
4. Human tone (0–15)
5. Long-term usefulness (0–15)
6. Text PJ earned CTA (0–15)

### Pass / Fail
- ≥ 80 → protect
- 65–79 → revise
- < 65 → unpublish or rewrite
- Any category < 8 → mandatory review

---

## Pruning Doctrine
- Fewer great pages > many average ones
- Removing pages increases trust
- Silence is better than confusion

---

## Final System Check
- Did a human actually ask this?
- Does this reduce pressure?
- Would this still matter in 2 years?

If unsure: **slow down**.

Clarity before cost.
