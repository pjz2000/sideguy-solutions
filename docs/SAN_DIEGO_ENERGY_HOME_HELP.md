# SideGuy — San Diego Energy Home Help  
**Canonical Content & Trust Doctrine**

---

## Mission (Locked)

SideGuy exists to reduce confusion **before money is spent**.

We are:
- A clarity layer  
- Not a contractor  
- Not a utility  
- Not a sales funnel  

We help people **avoid bad decisions** as often as we help them make good ones.

**Clarity before cost.**

---

## Global Positioning (Locked)

- Talk to a human when Google fails  
- We explain options — you decide  
- No hype, no urgency, no pressure  

---

## Mandatory Page Elements (All Energy Pages)

Every page must include:

1. Plain-English problem framing (first 2 sentences)  
2. Why Google makes this confusing  
3. What people usually get wrong  
4. When **NOT** to spend money  
5. Legit options (including *do nothing*)  
6. Calm human off-ramp (Text PJ)

---

## Anti-Bullshit Rules (Non-Negotiable)

Never:
- Say “best”
- Say “guaranteed”
- Fake urgency
- Imply exclusive access
- Copy contractor or SaaS sales language

---

## Trust Signals (Use Naturally)

- “This might not apply to you”
- “This is often oversold”
- “Most people don’t need this”
- “Here’s when this is a waste of money”

If a scammer would like the page — rewrite it.

---

## San Diego–Specific Context

Where relevant, explain:

- SDG&E billing complexity
- Tiered rates & usage spikes
- Coastal climate misconceptions
- Renters vs homeowners
- Older homes vs newer construction

No exaggeration. No fear.

---

## Programs You May Reference (Factual Only)

- CARE / FERA  
- Energy Savings Assistance (ESA)  
- LIHEAP  
- Publicly verifiable local rebates (no amounts unless confirmed)

Always include:
> “Programs change and eligibility varies.”

---

## CTA Rules

Primary CTA:
- **Text PJ — clarity, not sales**

Secondary CTA:
- Read a related guide

Never:
- “Apply Now”
- Forms
- Forced funnels

---

## Success Metric (Real)

A page succeeds when:
- The reader feels calmer
- They understand tradeoffs
- They trust the site
- They know what *not* to do

Traffic is secondary.  
Trust compounds.

---

## Signal → Content Engine

Every real question is signal.

Signals include:
- Texts
- Emails
- “Is this normal?”
- “Why is this so expensive?”
- “Do I really need this?”

Rules:
- If no human asked it — wait
- Fewer pages, higher trust
- Reality beats keyword guessing

---

## Standard Energy Page Titles

- “Do I really need ___ in San Diego?”
- “Why is ___ so expensive here?”
- “When ___ is a waste of money”
- “Who actually benefits from ___?”
- “What happens if I do nothing?”

---

## Final Law

Build SideGuy as if:
- Regulation is coming
- Trust is scarce
- This must last 10 years

No shortcuts.
No hype.
No regret.
