# AI Transition & Human Mediation Layer

Updated: February 09, 2026

AI is accelerating task displacement across industries.

SideGuy exists as a **human mediation layer** when:

- money is involved
- safety is involved
- accessibility is involved
- employment is affected
- uncertainty exists

Automation assists explanation and organization.
Humans retain judgment, accountability, and care.

Rule:
If uncertainty exists — escalate to a human.
