<h1>Ahoy Transportation – San Diego</h1>

<p><strong>Ahoy.</strong> This page exists because transportation in San Diego is rarely as simple as it sounds.</p>

<p>
SideGuy is not a transportation company. We don’t book rides, sell packages, or push apps.
We help locals and visitors understand their options before money changes hands.
</p>

<h2>What “Ahoy Transportation” Means</h2>
<p>
Ahoy is a signal — you’ve entered guidance waters.
This is about movement, timing, tradeoffs, and choosing the right option for <em>your</em> situation.
</p>

<h2>Common Situations We See</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Airport rides that suddenly get complicated</li>
  <li>Event and venue transportation with traffic surprises</li>
  <li>One-off help: pickups, drop-offs, deliveries</li>
  <li>Ongoing needs for family members or work</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your Real Options (No Spin)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Rideshare – convenient, but variable</li>
  <li>Private drivers – reliable, higher cost</li>
  <li>Shuttles – efficient, schedule dependent</li>
  <li>Public transit – situationally useful</li>
  <li>Asking for help – often overlooked</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why San Diego Is Different</h2>
<p>
Coastal distances, inland traffic, event surges, airport timing, and neighborhood layout all matter.
Generic advice breaks fast here.
</p>

<h2>When to Talk to a Human</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You’re short on time</li>
  <li>Pricing doesn’t make sense</li>
  <li>You’re coordinating multiple people</li>
  <li>You just want a straight answer</li>
</ul>

<h2>The SideGuy Role</h2>
