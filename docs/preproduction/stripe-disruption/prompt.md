STRIPE DISRUPTION — CPU-GPT PREPRODUCTION PROMPT

GOAL:
Identify where Stripe’s platform behavior creates friction, lock-in, or value leakage for operators, and document disruption angles that reduce cost, risk, or latency.

SCOPE (OBSERVATION ONLY):
- Payments flow
- Settlement speed
- Fee structure
- Account risk / freezes
- Platform dependency
- Data ownership
- Support latency
- Cross-border friction

WHAT TO CAPTURE:
- Exact operator complaints (phrases)
- Repeated confusion points
- Situations where Stripe becomes a bottleneck
- Scenarios where alternatives clearly win
- Moments where “clarity before cost” matters

WHAT NOT TO DO:
- No selling
- No comparison charts
- No claims of superiority
- No implementation yet

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Bullet observations
- Short scenarios
- Plain language
- One idea per line

STATUS:
OFF (do not promote without Sound Check)
