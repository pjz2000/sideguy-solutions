# SideGuy — Intake, Safety & Fit Engine

## Core Principle
Not every request becomes a service.
Saying NO builds trust.

## Intake Questions
- What is the real goal?
- Is this urgent or just stressful?
- Is this safe?
- Could this be solved without hiring?

## Classification
- Information only
- Clarity needed
- Simple help
- Referral out
- Not a fit

## Automatic Not-a-Fit
- Medical
- Legal
- Skilled trades
- Panic-driven requests
