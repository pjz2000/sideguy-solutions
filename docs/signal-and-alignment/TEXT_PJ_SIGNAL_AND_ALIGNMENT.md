# SideGuy — Text PJ Signal Capture & Page Expectation Alignment  
**Convert Clicks into Signal, Not Pressure**

---

## Core Reality
- People clicked because they were unsure  
- They did NOT click to buy  
- They clicked to understand  

Text PJ exists to catch that exact moment.

---

## Primary Goal
- Make texting feel safe, optional, and human  
- Capture the question behind the click  
- Reduce friction without creating pressure  

---

## Text PJ Positioning (Locked)
- “Not sales”  
- “No obligation”  
- “Just thinking it through with a human”  

---

## Where Text PJ Must Appear
- Above the fold (soft mention)  
- After tradeoff explanations  
- After “when NOT to” sections  
- At the end of every page  

---

## Approved Text PJ Copy (Rotate Naturally)
- “Not sure what to do next? Text PJ.”  
- “If this feels confusing, text PJ and we’ll think it through.”  
- “You don’t have to decide today — text PJ if you want clarity.”  
- “This might not apply to you. If you want to talk it out, text PJ.”  

---

## Text PJ Anti-Sales Rules
- Never say “book”  
- Never say “schedule”  
- Never say “free consultation”  
- Never imply urgency  
- Never imply scarcity  

---

## What Text PJ Is For
- Clarifying the real question  
- Helping someone decide if they need help at all  
- Saying NO when appropriate  
- Logging confusion patterns  

---

## What Text PJ Is NOT For
- Closing deals  
- Quoting prices  
- Handling emergencies  
- Acting as a support desk  

---

## Conversation Flow (Internal Logic)
1. Acknowledge confusion  
2. Restate the problem in plain language  
3. Ask ONE clarifying question  
4. Offer options (including doing nothing)  
5. Suggest a next step only if earned  

---

## Signal Capture Requirements (Internal)
- Log the first question verbatim  
- Tag the confusion type  
- Note which page they came from  
- Store phrasing exactly as written  

### Approved Confusion Tags
- Cost fear  
- Overwhelm  
- Mistrust  
- Comparison paralysis  
- Timing uncertainty  
- “Do I really need this?”

# Page Expectation Alignment Engine

## Core Insight
- Every click carries an expectation  
- Most pages fail in the first 5 seconds  
- Alignment beats persuasion  

---

## First 5 Seconds Rule (Mandatory)
The opening must answer:

**“Yes, this page understands why you clicked.”**

Do NOT:
- Explain yet  
- Sell  
- Generalize  

---

## How to Determine Expectation
- Look at the exact query  
- Identify the emotional driver:
  - stress  
  - fear  
  - confusion  
  - comparison  
  - regret avoidance  

---

## Opening Paragraph Templates (Use One)
- “If you’re here because ___, you’re not alone.”  
- “Most people land here because they’re trying to decide ___.”  
- “This page is for people wondering whether ___ actually makes sense.”  
- “You probably searched this because something feels off.”  

---

## Anti-Mismatch Rules
- Never open with definitions  
- Never open with marketing language  
- Never assume intent to buy  
- Never jump to solutions  

---

## Expectation Confirmers to Include
- Name the doubt explicitly  
- Normalize hesitation  
- State what this page WILL and WILL NOT do  

Examples:
- “This page will not sell you anything.”  
- “We’ll explain when this helps and when it doesn’t.”  
- “If you leave deciding to do nothing, that’s a valid outcome.”  

---

## Structural Flow After Alignment
1. Expectation confirmation  
2. Why this is confusing (Google gap)  
3. Tradeoffs  
4. When NOT to act  
5. Calm next step (Text PJ)  

---

## Query → Intro Mapping
- “help” queries → reassurance first  
- “why” queries → explanation first  
- “worth it” queries → tradeoffs first  
- “near me” queries → scope clarification first  

---

## Success Metrics (Not Conversions)
- People opening with “sorry to bug you”  
- People saying “this helped”  
- People not buying and thanking us  
- Repeat texts weeks later  

---

## Long-Term Effect
- SideGuy becomes a thinking partner  
- Traffic compounds into understanding  
- SEO reflects real human language  
- Trust becomes the conversion  

---

## Final Check
- Does this make texting feel safe?  
- Does it reduce pressure?  
- Does it honor hesitation?  

**If unsure, slow down.  
Clarity before cost.**
