<h1>How AI Agents Get Paid</h1>

<p>AI agents don’t earn salaries or subscriptions. They are paid when a defined job completes.</p>

<h2>What problem this solves</h2>
<p>This model avoids paying for idle tools and keeps costs aligned with real output.</p>

<h2>How payment usually happens</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A job is triggered</li>
  <li>The agent runs within set rules</li>
  <li>Payment occurs after completion</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where humans stay involved</h2>
<p>Humans monitor results, approve outcomes, and handle edge cases.</p>

<h2>When this makes sense</h2>
<p>Clearly scoped tasks with measurable completion.</p>

<h2>When it does not</h2>
<p>Subjective work or decisions requiring constant human presence.</p>
