<h1>When Not to Use AI Agent Payments</h1>

<p>Pay-per-use models are useful, but they are not universal.</p>

<h2>What problem this avoids</h2>
<p>Using automation where humans should stay primary.</p>

<h2>When this model struggles</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Constant, high-volume work</li>
  <li>Unclear deliverables</li>
  <li>High-trust decisions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where humans stay involved</h2>
<p>All critical decisions and sensitive outcomes.</p>

<h2>When another approach is better</h2>
<p>When continuity matters more than flexibility.</p>
