subject=SideGuy as Life Tech & AI Concierge
tags=positioning,life-tech,concierge,ai,human

SideGuy is not software you log into.
It is something you add to your life and work.

It exists to slow decisions down, not speed them up.
To protect attention, not consume it.

AI assists thinking.
MCP provides rails.
Humans keep judgment.

SideGuy is the glue between them.

subject=Keep SideGuy Nearby
tags=ambient,product-feel,everyday-life,concierge

SideGuy works best when it is nearby, not open.
Not logged in. Not scheduled.

It should surface in moments where something feels off:
before signing, before buying, before committing.

It is remembered, not launched.

subject=Operator Mode
tags=workflow,operator-mode,thinking,decision-making

Operator Mode is calm.
Not hustle. Not optimization.

Move to reduce cognitive load.
Learn from raw input (YouTube).
Think with GPT as a mirror, not an authority.
Structure action with MCP.
Keep humans as final decision-makers.

If something increases pressure or urgency, it is not Operator Mode.

subject=Learn to GPT
tags=learning,ai,youtube,gpt,mcp

YouTube is raw input, not authority.
GPT is a thinking partner, not an answer machine.

The skill is asking:
What matters?
What are the tradeoffs?
Who is this advice not for?
What is the cautious next step?

Learning is orientation, not consumption.

subject=YouTube with GPT Checklist
tags=learning,process,ai-literacy

Before watching: clarify the problem.
During: pause and interrogate assumptions.
After: summarize, map risks, identify alternatives.

The goal is not more videos.
The goal is fewer bad decisions.

subject=Routes We Don’t Recommend
tags=trust,negative-guidance,decision-making

SideGuy builds trust by saying no.

We do not recommend:
- Long contracts under pressure
- Adding tools before removing old ones
- Paying for speed without clarity
- Believing guarantees in complex systems

Fast routes are often expensive detours.

subject=Money as Mobility
tags=money,philosophy,mobility,decisions

Money is not a score.
It is the ability to move, pause, exit, or change direction.

Costs are tolls:
money, time, attention, stress.

SideGuy helps people see tolls before committing to a road.

subject=Transport Origins
tags=origin-story,mobility,philosophy

SideGuy started as a transport idea.

Not about cars.
About helping people get from where they are
to where they are trying to go.

That same problem exists in money, tech, work, and life.

subject=Encinitas × SideGuy
tags=locality,origin,encinitas,san-diego

Encinitas shaped SideGuy.

Movement, pace, conversations, openness.
Lower cognitive friction leads to clearer decisions.

SideGuy grew naturally in that environment.

----

date=2026-01-13 19:16
subject=San Diego Decisions
tags=local-decisions,travel,moving,vacation

San Diego decisions look easy online.
In reality, small choices change everything.

Neighborhoods feel different than listings.
Commutes feel different than maps.
The wrong choice gets expensive quickly.

SideGuy is clarity before booking.

subject=Reroutes We Helped With
tags=outcomes,trust,real-world

Not testimonials.
Not wins.

Just reroutes:
Paused contracts.
Canceled tools.
Chose to wait.
Did nothing.

Small changes. Real relief.
