    <h1>AI adoption cost breakdown — how to budget for pilots and rollouts</h1>

    <p class="lede">A practical breakdown of likely costs and how to plan a budget for pilots, fixed work, and ongoing operations.</p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Pilot costs</h2>
      <p>Typical pilot costs: $2,500–$8,000 depending on scope, integrations, and data prep. That includes discovery, a small build, testing, and a short measurement window.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Data preparation</h2>
      <p>Data cleaning, sampling, and minimal labeling are often the largest hidden costs. Estimate a few days to a few weeks for non-trivial data prep depending on quality.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Hosting & API fees</h2>
      <p>Ongoing costs include cloud hosting, API usage for models, and storage—these vary by usage. Include conservative monthly estimates in quotes.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Ongoing maintenance</h2>
      <p>Plan for monitoring, retraining, and operational support. A small retainer or hourly support contract is common after a pilot.</p>
