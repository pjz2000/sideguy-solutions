TOPIC: Payments Infrastructure  

WHAT CHANGED:
Payment processing shifted faster than expected toward instant settlement,
stablecoins, and platform-controlled fee extraction.

WHY IT MATTERS:
Most operators still believe payments settle in days by necessity.
In reality, delay now exists mainly to preserve platform leverage.

WHAT MOST PEOPLE MISSED:
Stripe, PayPal, and similar platforms did not reduce friction —
they repositioned it as “safety” while capturing float and data.

WHAT WE DECIDED:
SideGuy will prioritize clarity, optionality, and ownership-first
payment paths over default SaaS processors.

OPEN QUESTIONS:
- How many operators will choose speed once shown the difference?
- What education is required before trust shifts?
