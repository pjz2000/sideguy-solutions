<h1>When to use on-chain settlements for payments</h1>

<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — this page documents what changed, why it's confusing, and neutral options; it is informational, not a sales pitch.</p>

<section id="what-changed">
  <h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
  <p>Adoption of on-chain settlement options increased in niche cases, with faster finality on some chains and new stablecoin rails that reduce volatility risk for merchants.</p>
</section>

<section id="why-confused">
  <h2>Why this confused people</h2>
  <p>The technical terms and custody choices (custodial vs self-custody) confuse merchant decisions and integration requirements.</p>
</section>

<section id="what-breaks">
  <h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
  <p>Poorly chosen rails can add reconciliation complexity, tax and compliance needs, and potential conversion costs back to fiat.</p>
</section>

<section id="options">
  <h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Consider on-chain for international micro-payments or where instant settlement matters.</li>
    <li>Use stablecoins with trusted custody partners to reduce volatility.</li>
    <li>Evaluate compliance and tax implications before adoption.</li>
  </ul>
