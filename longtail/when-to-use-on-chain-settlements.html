<h1>When to use on-chain settlements — a practical guide</h1>
<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — what changed, why it’s confusing, what breaks, and neutral options.</p>

<h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
<ul><li>On-chain settlement pilots expanded for specific marketplace and reconciliation use-cases.</li></ul>

<h2>Why this confused people</h2>
<p>Marketing can overstate readiness; real-world reconciliation and custody are non-trivial.</p>

<h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
<p>Poor reconciliation and regulatory confusion that cause disputes and delays.</p>

<h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
<p>Limit on-chain where reconciliation is defined and use tested on/off ramps; prefer partners with accountability and guarantees.</p>
