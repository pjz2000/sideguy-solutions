<h1>How to read your payment processor statement — a simple guide</h1>
<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — what changed, why it’s confusing, what breaks, and neutral options.</p>

<h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
<ul><li>Statement layouts vary widely and new adjustment types (e.g., network fees) are appearing more often.</li></ul>

<h2>Why this confused people</h2>
<p>Line items aren’t standardized and terminology differs by processor.</p>

<h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
<p>Missed fees and reconciliations that reduce profit or lead to billing errors.</p>

<h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
<p>Request a sample statement, get a short line-by-line explanation from support, and compare to prior months.</p>

<h2>If this affected you, text PJ</h2>
