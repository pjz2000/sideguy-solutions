<h1>AI for local marketing: small business checklist</h1>

<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — this page documents what changed, why it's confusing, and neutral options; it is informational, not a sales pitch.</p>

<section id="what-changed">
  <h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
  <p>AI tools now allow rapid ad-copy generation, localized content, and scheduling; adoption lowers labor but requires careful quality checks.</p>
</section>

<section id="why-confused">
  <h2>Why this confused people</h2>
  <p>Many tools make big claims; businesses need a measured pilot and expected ROI to decide whether to scale.</p>
</section>

<section id="what-breaks">
  <h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
  <p>Poorly tuned AI can create off-brand messaging, incorrect local info, or spammy content that harms reputation.</p>
</section>

<section id="options">
  <h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Start with a small pilot on a low-cost campaign with clear metrics.</li>
    <li>Use human-in-the-loop review to keep brand voice consistent.</li>
  </ul>
