<h1>AI for payment fraud detection — what merchants need to know</h1>
<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — what changed, why it’s confusing, what breaks, and neutral options.</p>

<h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
<ul><li>AI models are increasingly used to flag suspicious transactions and automate review queues.</li></ul>

<h2>Why this confused people</h2>
<p>Score thresholds and vendor tuning vary; merchants don’t always see the model reasoning behind declines.</p>

<h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
<p>Higher false declines that lead to lost sales or unresolved fraud losses.</p>

<h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
<p>Work with your processor to tune thresholds, add manual review for edge cases, and use chargeback alerts.</p>
