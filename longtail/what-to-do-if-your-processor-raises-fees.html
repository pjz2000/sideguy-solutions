<h1>What to do if your payment processor raises fees</h1>
<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — what changed, why it’s confusing, what breaks, and neutral options.</p>

<h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
<ul><li>Processor fees were adjusted for some merchants and some programs introduced new components or surcharges.</li></ul>

<h2>Why this confused people</h2>
<p>Fee notices can be buried in terms and dashboards; merchants don’t always receive clear examples or calculations.</p>

<h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
<p>Unexpected margin compression and cashflow problems.</p>

<h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
<p>Ask for a sample statement, negotiate, compare processors, or switch pricing models; get a short fee audit before moving.</p>
