<h1>How to switch payment providers without downtime</h1>

<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — this page documents what changed, why it's confusing, and neutral options; it is informational, not a sales pitch.</p>

<section id="what-changed">
  <h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
  <p>Payment platforms and processors now offer more self-service tools and integration options, but migration procedures vary and require coordination between technical and finance teams.</p>
</section>

<section id="why-confused">
  <h2>Why this confused people</h2>
  <p>Different providers use varying terminology, have different test modes and webhook behaviors, and statements may be hard to compare directly—making migrations risky without a checklist.</p>
</section>

<section id="what-breaks">
  <h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Customer payments may fail or be double-charged.</li>
    <li>Recurring subscriptions can be disrupted, leading to revenue loss and customer support overhead.</li>
    <li>Refunds and disputes may be mishandled if webhooks or reconciliation are not tested.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="options">
  <h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Run a parallel integration: keep old provider active while testing the new one.</li>
    <li>Use a test customer group and staged switchover times (low-traffic windows).</li>
    <li>Ensure clear reconciliation and rollback processes before flipping live traffic.</li>
  </ul>
