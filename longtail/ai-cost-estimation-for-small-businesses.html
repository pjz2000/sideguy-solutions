<h1>AI cost estimation for small businesses</h1>

<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — this page documents what changed, why it's confusing, and neutral options; it is informational, not a sales pitch.</p>

<section id="what-changed">
  <h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
  <p>Cloud AI pricing has matured; however, total project cost includes data work, integration, monitoring, and potential subscription model fees.</p>
</section>

<section id="why-confused">
  <h2>Why this confused people</h2>
  <p>Vendors quote per-inference or per-token pricing but integration and maintenance costs often dominate small projects.</p>
</section>

<section id="what-breaks">
  <h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
  <p>Under-budgeted pilots can fail mid-project when integration and monitoring costs surface unexpectedly.</p>
</section>

<section id="options">
  <h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Estimate engineering hours for integration and monitoring, not just model fees.</li>
    <li>Start small with a scoped pilot and measure OPEX before scaling.</li>
  </ul>
