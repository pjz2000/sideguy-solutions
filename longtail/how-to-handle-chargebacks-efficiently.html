<h1>How to handle chargebacks efficiently</h1>

<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — this page documents what changed, why it's confusing, and neutral options; it is informational, not a sales pitch.</p>

<section id="what-changed">
  <h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
  <p>Dispute flows and evidence submission options have become more precise; some processors provide clearer evidence portals and automated dispute tools.</p>
</section>

<section id="why-confused">
  <h2>Why this confused people</h2>
  <p>Terms, timelines, and evidence expectations differ by network and provider; merchants are often unsure which disputes are worth pursuing.</p>
</section>

<section id="what-breaks">
  <h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
  <p>Ignoring chargebacks can increase loss and hurt processing standing; contesting without proper evidence may waste time and money.</p>
</section>

<section id="options">
  <h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Document transactions thoroughly (receipts, IP, customer communication) to streamline disputes.</li>
    <li>Use processor tools to automate evidence submission where available.</li>
    <li>For small or clear refunds, consider refunding to avoid costly disputes and chargeback fees.
  </ul>
