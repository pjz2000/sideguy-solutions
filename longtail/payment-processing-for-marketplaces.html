<h1>Payment processing for marketplaces</h1>

<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — this page documents what changed, why it's confusing, and neutral options; it is informational, not a sales pitch.</p>

<section id="what-changed">
  <h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
  <p>More platforms provide split-settlement, marketplace SDKs, and easier vendor onboarding; however, fee and liability models vary widely.</p>
</section>

<section id="why-confused">
  <h2>Why this confused people</h2>
  <p>Marketplace operators must choose between acting as a money transmitter or using managed payouts; terminology and obligations create confusion.</p>
</section>

<section id="what-breaks">
  <h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
  <p>Poorly designed flows can create liability, misallocated payouts, and customer disputes across buyers and sellers.</p>
</section>

<section id="options">
  <h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use marketplace-aware payment providers that support split payouts and compliance tools.</li>
    <li>Consider hosted vendor onboarding to reduce compliance burden.</li>
  </ul>
