<h1>How tokenized payments work — simple explanation</h1>

<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — this page explains what changed, why it’s confusing, what can break if ignored, and neutral options.</p>

<h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
<p>Tokenization became more common as a security and routing mechanism for both off-chain and tokenized rails.</p>

<h2>Why this confused people</h2>
<p>Different vendors call tokens different things and the trust model varies by implementation.</p>

<h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
<p>Failed refunds, improper token refresh handling, and reconciliation gaps.</p>

<h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
<p>Use tokenization for PCI scope reduction and for marketplace splits with clear reconciliation processes.</p>
