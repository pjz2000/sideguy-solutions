<h1>Cryptocurrency payments — pros and cons for merchants</h1>
<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — what changed, why it’s confusing, what breaks, and neutral options.</p>

<h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
<ul><li>Tools to accept crypto payments and settle to fiat have become more available, but custody and volatility remain concerns.</li></ul>

<h2>Why this confused people</h2>
<p>Terms like 'instant settlement' or 'zero fees' often mask conversion costs and custody responsibilities.</p>

<h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
<p>Unexpected FX losses, reconciliation mismatch, and regulatory questions for business accounting.</p>

<h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
<p>Use vetted payment processors that handle immediate fiat conversion, or accept crypto for niche cases with clear accounting policies.</p>
