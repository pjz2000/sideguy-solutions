<h1>Blockchain payment processing explained — tokenized payments & rails</h1>

<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — this page explains what changed, why it’s confusing, what can break if ignored, and neutral options.</p>

<h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
<ul>
<li>More tokenization and on-chain settlement experiments emerged for marketplaces and receipts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why this confused people</h2>
<p>Messaging around blockchain benefits often conflates proofs-of-concept with production-ready payments rails.</p>

<h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
<p>Poor reconciliation, unclear custody responsibilities, and unexpected on/off-ramps fees.</p>

<h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
<p>Use tokenization for receipts or settlement proofs only when you have clear reconciliation paths and vendor guarantees.</p>

<p>Blockchain can help with settlement transparency, tokenized receipts, and programmable payouts, but it’s not a free substitute for regulated payment rails.</p>
<h2>When blockchain helps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Programmable payouts for marketplaces</li>
<li>Immutable receipts for disputes</li>
<li>Cross-border settlements in tokenized form (with fiat off-ramps)</li>
</ul>
