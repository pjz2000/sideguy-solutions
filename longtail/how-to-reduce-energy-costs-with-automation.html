<h1>How to reduce energy costs with automation — small business tips</h1>
<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — what changed, why it’s confusing, what breaks, and neutral options.</p>

<h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
<ul><li>Smart thermostats, scheduling, and monitoring tools became more accessible to small businesses and integrate with energy rebate programs.</li></ul>

<h2>Why this confused people</h2>
<p>Rebate availability and program specifics change regionally; performance claims vary by installation quality.</p>

<h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
<p>Poor ROI from improper installation or missing rebate paperwork.</p>

<h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
<p>Start with a simple audit, check available rebates, and choose vendors that support paperwork or provide references.</p>
