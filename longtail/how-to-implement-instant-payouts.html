<h1>How to implement instant payouts</h1>

<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — this page documents what changed, why it's confusing, and neutral options; it is informational, not a sales pitch.</p>

<section id="what-changed">
  <h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
  <p>Several providers now offer instant or near-instant payouts using new rails; these come with fee and eligibility trade-offs.</p>
</section>

<section id="why-confused">
  <h2>Why this confused people</h2>
  <p>Advertised "instant" often requires account eligibility checks and may not be available to all merchant types or currencies.</p>
</section>

<section id="what-breaks">
  <h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
  <p>Unexpected fees and payout holds can hurt cashflow planning; selection without testing can create reconciliation problems.</p>
</section>

<section id="options">
  <h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Test with a small subset of payout flows and compare fees for true net cash impact.</li>
    <li>Negotiate eligibility and fee access with providers before switching on broadly.</li>
  </ul>
