<h1>Choose between ACH and card payments — when to use each</h1>
<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — what changed, why it’s confusing, what breaks, and neutral options.</p>

<h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
<ul><li>ACH rails matured for recurring billing, offering lower per-transaction costs but different dispute and return risks.</li></ul>

<h2>Why this confused people</h2>
<p>Fee comparisons can be misleading because ACH tends to have different risk and return behaviors compared to cards.</p>

<h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
<p>Unexpected returns, slower settlement, or cashflow mismatches for businesses used to card timing.</p>

<h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
<p>Use ACH for high-value or recurring B2B charges; use card for smaller, consumer transactions; consider mixed strategies for net cost optimization.</p>
