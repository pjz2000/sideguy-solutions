      <li>Local references and recent work photos</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Interview questions</h2>

      <li>How long have you worked locally?</li>
      <li>Can you provide recent references and photos?</li>
      <li>Who will be on site and subcontracted?</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Confirm who will pull permits and check local inspection requirements for your project.</p>
