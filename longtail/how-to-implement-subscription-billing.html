<h1>How to implement subscription billing — practical steps</h1>
<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — what changed, why it’s confusing, what breaks, and neutral options.</p>

<h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
<ul><li>Subscription tools integrated with billing and accounting, improving retry logic and dispute handling for recurring charges.</li></ul>

<h2>Why this confused people</h2>
<p>Different platforms use different retry & dunning logic and varying fee structures for retries and failed payments.</p>

<h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
<p>High churn, missed revenue, and poor customer experience from opaque retry attempts or failed communications.</p>

<h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
<p>Use tested subscription platforms, implement clear dunning & communications, and monitor failed payments and auto-retry logic.</p>
