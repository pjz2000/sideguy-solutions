<h1>How to audit your payment processor in 30 minutes</h1>

<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — this page documents what changed, why it's confusing, and neutral options; it is informational, not a sales pitch.</p>

<section id="what-changed">
  <h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
  <p>Statement line-items, interchange flows, and payout timings are more granular; many merchants miss line-item differences that matter to margins.</p>
</section>

<section id="why-confused">
  <h2>Why this confused people</h2>
  <p>Terms like interchange, assessment, and pass-through add complexity; statements vary by provider and require a line-by-line glance.</p>
</section>

<section id="what-breaks">
  <h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
  <p>Unexpected fees hurt margins and cashflow; missing fee categories when comparing quotes can lead to poor provider choices.</p>
</section>

<section id="options">
  <h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Compare a single representative month across providers.</li>
    <li>Ask for a sample merchant statement with detailed interchange breakdown.</li>
    <li>Consider an independent audit if statements are unreadable.</li>
  </ul>
