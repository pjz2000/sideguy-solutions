  <main id="main">
    <p><strong>Clarity before selling:</strong> This page explains your options; we do not recommend vendors—call for estimates from licensed local pros.</p>

    <h2>Quick overview</h2>
    <p>Under-sink leaks can be caused by loose fittings, damaged P-traps, or worn valves. If you can safely turn off the water and apply a temporary fix, do so; otherwise call a licensed plumber.</p>

    <h2>Who to call</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Licensed plumber (general plumbing license)</li>
      <li>Handyman for minor non-pressurized drips (only if small and safe)</li>
      <li>Emergency plumber for major flooding or if shutoff is not working</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What to expect</h2>
    <p>Initial visit: 30–60 minutes. Typical fixes: tighten fittings, replace P-trap, or replace a valve. Cost ballpark: $120–$450 depending on parts and time.</p>

    <h2>Pre-visit checklist</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Turn off the local shutoff valve under sink (if available)</li>
      <li>Clear the cabinet so tech can work</li>
      <li>Take photos of the leak area</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Next steps</h2>
    <p>Get 2–3 quotes, confirm license and insurance, ask about warranties on parts and labor, and request photos of the repair if possible.</p>
