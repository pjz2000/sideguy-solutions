<h1>How to prepare for a payment audit — checklist for merchants</h1>
<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — what changed, why it’s confusing, what breaks, and neutral options.</p>

<h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
<ul><li>Audits now look for stronger reconciliation trails and clearer documentation for chargebacks and refunds.</li></ul>

<h2>Why this confused people</h2>
<p>Merchants are often unsure which documents to include or how to format reconciliation evidence.</p>

<h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
<p>Failed audits, fines, or extended account reviews that affect settlements.</p>

<h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
<p>Keep organized statement archives, reconciliation reports, and a chargeback log; ask your processor for audit guidance.</p>

<h2>If this affected you, text PJ</h2>
