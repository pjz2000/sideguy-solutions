<h1>Payment retry strategies for subscriptions</h1>

<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — this page documents what changed, why it's confusing, and neutral options; it is informational, not a sales pitch.</p>

<section id="what-changed">
  <h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
  <p>Subscription platforms now offer built-in retry windows, smart dunning sequences, and automated communication templates to recover failed payments.</p>
</section>

<section id="why-confused">
  <h2>Why this confused people</h2>
  <p>Different platforms handle retries differently; aggressive retries can annoy customers while weak retries reduce recovery rates.</p>
</section>

<section id="what-breaks">
  <h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
  <p>Poor retry strategies lead to unnecessary churn, higher support load, and lost recurring revenue.</p>
</section>

<section id="options">
  <h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use a graduated dunning schedule: gentle first notice, stronger escalation for later retries.</li>
    <li>Use smart retries keyed to card network windows and customer timezones.</li>
    <li>Consider alternative payment methods (ACH) for large recurring bills.
  </ul>
