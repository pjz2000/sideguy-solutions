    <p><strong>Clarity before selling:</strong> This is an operational guide—get a sandbox environment, run test transactions, and schedule the final cutover during low traffic.</p>

    <h2>Plan and timeline</h2>
    <p>Plan a week of testing, staging integration, and a low-traffic cutover window. Keep both processors running in parallel during testing.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Test in sandbox with full payment flows</li>
      <li>Validate refunds, chargebacks, subscription renewals</li>
      <li>Prepare customer-facing communications</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Common pitfalls</h2>
    <p>Not testing refunds or recurring payments, and switching during peak hours. Validate webhook handling and reconciliation reports in parallel.</p>

    <h2>After cutover</h2>
    <p>Monitor settlement reports, reconcile closely for the first 7–14 days, and be ready to rollback if major issues appear.</p>

    <h3>FAQ</h3>
    <p><strong>Can I do this in one weekend?</strong> For some setups yes; however complex subscription and marketplace platforms usually need staged rollout and reconciliation time.</p>
