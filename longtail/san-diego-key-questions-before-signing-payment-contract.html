  </header>
  <main id="main">
    <p><strong>Clarity before selling:</strong> Check fees, termination terms, and reporting before you sign—small clauses can have big cost impacts.</p>

    <h2>Must-ask questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the exact pricing model and effective rate?</li>
      <li>Are there early termination fees or minimum terms?</li>
      <li>Who owns the merchant account and settlement access?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Red flags</h2>
    <p>Unclear chargeback handling, vague fees, and no clear statement format are warning signs.</p>

    <h3>FAQ</h3>
    <p><strong>Can I negotiate these terms?</strong> Often yes—share your volume and ask for clear interchange-plus pricing or concessions.</p>
