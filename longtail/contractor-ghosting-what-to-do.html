<h1>Contractor ghosted me — what to do in San Diego</h1>
<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — what changed, why it’s confusing, what breaks, and neutral options.</p>

<h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
<ul><li>Reports of contractor availability combined with some companies failing to finish jobs increased complaints in the region.</li></ul>

<h2>Why this confused people</h2>
<p>Promises, partial work, and unclear warranties make it hard to know remedy steps.</p>

<h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
<p>Partial or unsafe repairs, lien risks, and added costs to rehire or remediate.</p>

<h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
<p>Document everything, request contract terms in writing, check licensing, get local references, and consult small claims/licensing boards if needed.</p>

<h2>If this affected you, text PJ</h2>
