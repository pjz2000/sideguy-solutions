<h1>Understanding interchange fees for small businesses</h1>

<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — this page documents what changed, why it's confusing, and neutral options; it is informational, not a sales pitch.</p>

<section id="what-changed">
  <h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
  <p>Interchange rules and categories continue to be the dominant cost for card acceptance; nuance in card types affects merchant rates materially.</p>
</section>

<section id="why-confused">
  <h2>Why this confused people</h2>
  <p>Merchant statements combine interchange and processing marks, making it hard to see the underlying interchange costs.</p>
</section>

<section id="what-breaks">
  <h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
  <p>Ignoring interchange structure can leave money on the table and cause surprise costs during peak seasons or with certain payment types.</p>
</section>

<section id="options">
  <h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Review interchange categories with your processor and ask for examples for your industry.</li>
    <li>Consider routing or ACH for large or recurring payments when appropriate.</li>
  </ul>
