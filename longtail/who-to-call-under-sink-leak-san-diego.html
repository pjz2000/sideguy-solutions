<h1>Who to call for a leak under the sink in San Diego?</h1>

<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — this page documents what changed, why it's confusing, and neutral options; it is informational, not a sales pitch.</p>

<p>
A leak under the sink is one of those problems that looks small but can become expensive fast if left alone. This page helps you understand whether this is a quick DIY fix, a handyman job, or a plumber’s call—and what to do right now to limit damage.
</p>

<h2>Quick triage (do this first)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Shut off the cabinet supply valves or the main water if needed to stop running water.</li>
<li>Clear items from the cabinet and put a bucket or towels under the leak to catch water.</li>
<li>Try to identify the source: supply line, drain trap (P-trap), or faucet connection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who to call</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plumber:</strong> If the leak is from a pipe, drain trap, or you see water running constantly, call a plumber.</li>
<li><strong>Handyman:</strong> For minor leaks at flexible supply lines, loose connections, or replacing a faucet, a qualified handyman may suffice.</li>
<li><strong>Emergency service:</strong> If water is flooding, electrics are wet, or you can’t stop the flow—treat it as an emergency and call a 24/7 plumber.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Estimated cost in San Diego: simple repairs (tighten or replace a fitting) often run $75–$250. If pipes need replacement or access is difficult, costs rise. Get a quick photo, ask for a diagnosis cost, and prefer transparent pricing.
</p>

<h2>Local tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ask for a local license and proof of insurance.</li>
<li>Take photos and ask for a short explanation of the fix before work starts.</li>
<li>If the problem looks like mold or long-term leakage, document for insurance purposes.</li>
</ul>
