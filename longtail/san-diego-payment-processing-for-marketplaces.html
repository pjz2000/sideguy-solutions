  <main id="main">
    <p><strong>Clarity before selling:</strong> Marketplace payments vary by model—split payouts, compliance, and fees differ; this is an informational guide.</p>

    <h2>Quick overview</h2>
    <p>Marketplaces can use managed payout providers, platform processors, or split-pay systems; choose by scale, risk, and complexity.</p>

    <h2>Common models</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Platform-as-merchant (processor handles settlements)</li>
      <li>Managed payouts (provider splits funds to sellers)</li>
      <li>On-chain settlements for niche use cases</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What to watch for</h2>
    <p>Fee structure, chargeback routing, KYC/AML obligations, and how refunds are handled across sellers.</p>

    <h2>Checklist before choosing</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Map flows for payouts and refunds</li>
      <li>Confirm reporting and reconciliation capabilities</li>
      <li>Check seller onboarding KYC requirements</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Next steps</h2>
    <p>Run a short technical feasibility test with a sandbox account and validate reconciliation reports for 2–3 sample transactions.</p>
