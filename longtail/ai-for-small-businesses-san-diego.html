<h1>AI for small businesses in San Diego — practical uses & who to call</h1>

<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — this page explains what changed, why it confuses people, what can break if ignored, and neutral options.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> AI can automate admin, improve quoting, and speed customer responses—use vetted vendors and keep humans in the loop for safety and quality.</p>

<h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
<ul>
<li>More templated AI tools are offered to small businesses (support triage, quoting, simple automation).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why this confused people</h2>
<p>Terminology, vendor claims, and unclear data/permissions made it hard to know what a tool actually does and what the risks are.</p>

<h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
<p>Poor integrations, data leaks, or automated customer replies that damage trust.</p>

<h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
<p>Proof-of-concept trials, staged deployments, and vendor references; include human review points for any automated decision.</p>

<h2>If this affected you, text PJ</h2>
<p><a href="sms:+17604541860">Text PJ</a></p>

<h2>Common use cases</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automated replies and triage for support messages.</li>
<li>Estimate generation from photos or inputs (faster quotes).</li>
<li>Simple bookkeeping categorization and reconciliation assistance.</li>
<li>Chat/FAQ agents that hand off to humans for complex cases.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who to call</h2>
<p>Ask for local vendors with implementation experience, or contact an AI consultant for a short scope-and-risk review.</p>
