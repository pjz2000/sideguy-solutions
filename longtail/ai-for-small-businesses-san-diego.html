<h1>AI for small businesses in San Diego — practical uses & who to call</h1>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> AI can automate admin, improve quoting, and speed customer responses—use vetted vendors and keep humans in the loop for safety and quality.</p>

<h2>Common use cases</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automated replies and triage for support messages.</li>
<li>Estimate generation from photos or inputs (faster quotes).</li>
<li>Simple bookkeeping categorization and reconciliation assistance.</li>
<li>Chat/FAQ agents that hand off to humans for complex cases.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who to call</h2>
<p>Ask for local vendors with implementation experience, or contact an AI consultant for a short scope-and-risk review.</p>
