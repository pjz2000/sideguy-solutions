<h1>How to collect online payments safely — best practices for merchants</h1>
<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — what changed, why it’s confusing, what breaks, and neutral options.</p>

<h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
<ul><li>More turnkey payment integrations and hosted checkout options reduce PCI scope for merchants.</li></ul>

<h2>Why this confused people</h2>
<p>Different vendors offer different levels of scope reduction and claims can be unclear.</p>

<h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
<p>Exposure to card data, increased PCI burden, and regulatory risk.</p>

<h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
<p>Use hosted checkout or tokenization, ensure TLS, and request an SAQ from your vendor.</p>

<h2>If this affected you, text PJ</h2>
