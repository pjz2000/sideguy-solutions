<h1>AI ethics for small businesses — simple rules to follow</h1>

<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — this page explains what changed, why it confuses people, what can break if ignored, and neutral options.</p>

<h2>What changed (facts only)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Increased use of AI in customer-facing roles and for administrative decisions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why this confused people</h2>
<p>Unclear consent flows and varying vendor promises about fairness and bias mitigation.</p>

<h2>What breaks if you ignore it</h2>
<p>Customer complaints, biased outcomes, and regulatory risk.</p>

<h2>What options exist now (neutral)</h2>
<p>Audit training data, use human-in-loop for high-risk decisions, and keep simple logs for accountability.</p>

<h2>If this affected you, text PJ</h2>

<ul>
<li>Get consent for customer data when needed.</li>
<li>Keep humans in the decision loop for higher-risk actions.</li>
<li>Log decisions and keep a small audit trail for important workflows.</li>
</ul>
