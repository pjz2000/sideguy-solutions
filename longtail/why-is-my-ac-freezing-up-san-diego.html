<h1>Why is my AC freezing up and who should I call?</h1>

<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — this page documents what changed, why it's confusing, and neutral options; it is informational, not a sales pitch.</p>

<p>
When an air conditioner freezes, it usually means the evaporator coil is too cold relative to the airflow or refrigerant level. Quick checks can help you decide whether to call an HVAC tech now or schedule a service.
</p>

<h2>Common causes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Poor airflow:</strong> dirty filters or blocked vents reduce airflow and let the coil get too cold.</li>
<li><strong>Low refrigerant:</strong> leaks reduce pressure and can cause freezing; a licensed HVAC tech should repair and recharge.</li>
<li><strong>Dirty coils or malfunctioning blower:</strong> reduce heat transfer and lead to ice buildup.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to try first</h2>
<ul>
<li>Turn the system off and let ice melt (avoid forcing heat).</li>
<li>Replace the air filter and clear vents.</li>
<li>If the problem returns after a short test run, call a licensed HVAC technician.</li>
</ul>
