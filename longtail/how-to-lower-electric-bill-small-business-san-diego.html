<h1>How to lower your electric bill for a small business in San Diego</h1>

<p>
If your business is facing high energy bills, start with simple, verifiable steps that usually pay back quickly. Below are practical actions local businesses take to lower monthly costs and boost comfort.
</p>

<h2>Immediate steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Run a quick energy audit: check lighting, HVAC schedules, and plug-loads after hours.</li>
<li>Replace incandescent or CFLs with LED bulbs — cost-effective and fast.</li>
<li>Use smart thermostats and set schedules to avoid cooling/ heating empty spaces.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Medium-term improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Seal doors, windows, and add weatherstripping to prevent loss of conditioned air.</li>
<li>Service HVAC: dirty coils or low refrigerant reduce efficiency and increase run time.</li>
<li>Consider variable-speed drives for fans and pumps in larger operations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Local programs & incentives</h2>
<p>
San Diego Gas & Electric and local programs sometimes offer rebates for lighting upgrades, heat pump installations, and EV charging infrastructure—check current incentives before investing.
