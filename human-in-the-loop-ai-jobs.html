<h1>Human-in-the-Loop AI Jobs</h1>

<p>Human-in-the-loop AI jobs combine automated tasks with human review and decision-making.</p>

<h2>What problem this solves</h2>
<p>Fully automated systems fail when judgment is required. Human-in-the-loop models reduce that risk.</p>

<h2>How these jobs work</h2>
<ul>
  <li>An AI completes a defined task</li>
  <li>A human reviews or approves the result</li>
  <li>Escalation happens when needed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where humans still matter</h2>
<p>Accountability, exceptions, and trust remain human responsibilities.</p>

<h2>Who this is for (and not for)</h2>
<p>Useful where mistakes are costly. Slower for purely mechanical tasks.</p>

<p>If you want a second opinion on this approach, you can text PJ.</p>
