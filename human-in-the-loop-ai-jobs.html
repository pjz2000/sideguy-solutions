<h1>Human-in-the-Loop AI Jobs</h1>

<p>Human-in-the-loop AI jobs combine automated tasks with human review. AI handles repeatable work, while people stay responsible for decisions.</p>

<h2>Why this approach matters</h2>
<p>Fully automated systems can fail silently. Human oversight helps catch errors and provide context.</p>

<h2>What humans typically handle</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Approving results</li>
  <li>Reviewing edge cases</li>
  <li>Providing judgment and context</li>
</ul>
