<h1>What changed in the last 12 months — San Diego: service, costs, and tech</h1>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Over the past year, local service markets and household/business economics saw modest-to-significant shifts: contractor costs and wait times rose in many trades, energy programs and rebates expanded, small businesses adopted AI tools for efficiency, and homeowners have more incentive-driven options for energy upgrades. Below is a concise guide to the top changes, what they mean, and what to do next.</p>

<p class="guardrail"><strong>SideGuy:</strong> Clarity before selling — this page documents what changed, why it's confusing, and neutral options; it is informational, not a sales pitch.</p>

<h2>Top changes</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Service availability & lead times:</strong> Many trades reported longer wait times because of steady demand and constrained labor availability in the region. Expect scheduling delays for larger jobs.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing pressure:</strong> Material costs and labor rates increased for several common home services (HVAC, roofing, plumbing). Get multiple quotes and written estimates.</li>
<li><strong>Energy incentives grew:</strong> Local and state rebate programs expanded for heat pumps, efficient HVAC, and LED/lighting upgrades—some projects now offset a larger portion of cost.</li>
<li><strong>AI and digital tools adoption:</strong> Small businesses (including local contractors) increasingly use AI for admin, quoting, and estimates—expect more digital booking and clearer estimates, but verify details before paying.</li>
<li><strong>Payments and pricing models:</strong> More businesses offer online payments, digital estimates, and subscription-based maintenance plans—read the fine print on recurring charges.</li>
</ol>

<h2>What this means for you</h2>
<p>
- If you need work done, start early and expect longer scheduling windows for some trades. 
- Use photos and short videos to get better remote estimates (fast and more accurate). 
- For energy upgrades, check available rebates before you buy—contractors often can help with paperwork.
</p>

<h2>Practical steps (quick checklist)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Document the problem (photos + short description) to make remote quotes accurate.</li>
<li>Ask for itemized quotes and call out warranty, permit, and disposal fees.</li>
<li>Ask contractors whether they handle local rebate paperwork for energy work.</li>
<li>For urgent flooding or gas, treat as an emergency (call appropriate responders first).</li>
<li>Shop for transparent pricing and prefer contractors with local references and insurance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline / notable events</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mid-last-year: Several rebate programs were expanded; check SDG&amp;E and state energy portals for up-to-date offers.</li>
<li>Fall: Hiring slowdowns in some trades made scheduling slower during peak seasons.</li>
<li>Ongoing: Small business software and AI tools matured; many service providers now use photos, text, and online scheduling for initial triage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data & sources</h2>
<p>Sources for the above are local program sites, contractor feedback, and industry reports. If you want, I can gather links and specific rebate pages for your area (San Diego / North County).</p>
