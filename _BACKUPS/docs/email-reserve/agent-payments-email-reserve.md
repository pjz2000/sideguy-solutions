# Agent Payments — Email Reserve

Status: STORAGE ONLY
Purpose: Capture unfinished, exploratory, and situational email drafts
Audience: Operators, contractors, small business owners
Tone: Human-first, non-sales, non-hype

======================================================

ANGLE 1 — PROOF OF LIFE (NO PITCH)

======================================================

Subject: Quick thought I wanted to sanity check

A lot of people assume automation means locking into big platforms or long contracts.

What I’m seeing instead is small, narrow tasks being automated and only paid for when they actually run.

Not saying it’s right for everyone — just sharing in case it’s useful context.

======================================================

ANGLE 2 — HUMAN-FIRST REASSURANCE

======================================================

Subject: Automation with humans still in control

Just to clarify — the setups I’ve seen don’t replace people.

Agents handle narrow tasks. Humans approve outcomes and stay responsible when judgment matters.

If that distinction is important to you, happy to explain more.

======================================================

ANGLE 3 — ANTI-HYPE / GROUNDING

======================================================

Subject: No strategy — just clarity

This isn’t a strategy, platform, or “AI transformation.”

It’s just a different way to think about paying for work when it actually happens.

Sometimes that’s helpful. Sometimes it’s not.

======================================================

ANGLE 4 — SAN DIEGO OPERATOR CONTEXT

======================================================

Subject: Seeing this pop up locally

I’ve been talking to a few San Diego operators about automation costs lately.

Most don’t want subscriptions — they just want certain things handled when needed.

Sharing in case it’s relevant.

======================================================

ANGLE 5 — FOLLOW-UP WITHOUT PRESSURE

======================================================

Subject: No rush — just wanted to close the loop

No need to respond unless it’s useful.

Happy to share what I’ve seen or leave it there.

======================================================

RULES

======================================================

- Do not send at scale
- Rewrite before use
- Conversation > conversion
- Human clarity beats automation volume
- These are thinking tools, not campaigns
