# SideGuy Human Hold Queue



This folder contains **intentional non-actions**.



## Why this exists

Growth systems create pressure.

This system preserves judgment.



Not every good idea ships.

Not every signal becomes a page.

Not every conversation becomes SEO.



## Rules

- Append-only

- Human-written

- No automation

- No timers

- No scoring

- Silence is allowed



## When something goes here

- The signal is real, but timing is wrong

- The intent is unclear

- Publishing would add pressure

- Restraint is the better answer



## Exit criteria (optional)

- A real human asks for help

- Repeated signals over time

- External cost is increasing

- Confusion persists without clarity



If a system cannot tolerate waiting, it is not ready.
