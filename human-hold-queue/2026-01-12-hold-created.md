# Human Hold Entry — 2026-01-12



## What triggered this

Multiple strong system layers now exist.

Automation pressure is naturally increasing.



## Decision

Create a permanent Human Hold Queue before further expansion.



## Why holding is correct

- Restraint compounds trust

- Not acting reduces noise

- Timing matters more than coverage

- Silence can be a feature



## What we did NOT do

- Did not create new pages

- Did not automate decisions

- Did not add scoring

- Did not monetize



## Re-evaluation signal

When confusion persists *after* clarity attempts,

this may graduate out of hold.



Until then, waiting is the correct action.
