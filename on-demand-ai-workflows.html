<h1>On-Demand AI Workflows</h1>

<p>On-demand AI workflows are groups of tasks that only run when triggered. They don’t stay active in the background and don’t generate costs when idle.</p>

<h2>Why this model exists</h2>
<p>Many workflows are needed occasionally, not constantly. On-demand systems give businesses more control over when work runs.</p>

<h2>Common examples</h2>
<ul>
  <li>One-time data cleanup</li>
  <li>Document processing</li>
  <li>Internal reporting</li>
  <li>Follow-up tasks</li>
</ul>

<h2>Human oversight</h2>
<p>Workflows automate steps, but people still review outputs and handle edge cases.</p>
