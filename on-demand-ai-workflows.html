<h1>On-Demand AI Workflows</h1>

<p>On-demand AI workflows run only when needed. They do not operate continuously and do not charge unless work is triggered.</p>

<h2>What problem this solves</h2>
<p>Many teams need automation only at specific moments. On-demand workflows avoid paying for idle systems.</p>

<h2>How on-demand workflows work</h2>
<ul>
  <li>An event or request triggers the workflow</li>
  <li>The AI completes a defined process</li>
  <li>The workflow stops when finished</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where humans still matter</h2>
<p>Humans design workflows, approve results, and handle exceptions.</p>

<h2>Who this is for (and not for)</h2>
<p>Helpful for sporadic tasks. Less useful for always-on operations.</p>

<p>If you want a second opinion on whether this fits your situation, you can text PJ.</p>
