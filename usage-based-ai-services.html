<h1>Usage-Based AI Services</h1>

<p>Usage-based AI services are billed based on actual usage. If nothing runs, nothing is charged.</p>

<h2>How this differs from subscriptions</h2>
<p>Subscriptions bill continuously. Usage-based services align cost with completed work.</p>

<h2>When usage-based models make sense</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Irregular workloads</li>
  <li>One-off automation needs</li>
  <li>Careful testing before committing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Clarity before cost</h2>
<p>You should understand what runs and why before paying for it.</p>
