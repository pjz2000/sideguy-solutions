<h1>Usage-Based AI Services</h1>

<p>Usage-based AI services charge only when a task or service is used. Costs scale with actual activity, not time.</p>

<h2>What problem this solves</h2>
<p>Fixed subscriptions often charge regardless of value delivered. Usage-based models align cost with use.</p>

<h2>How usage-based services work</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Work is measured per task or job</li>
  <li>Costs apply only when work runs</li>
  <li>No charge when idle</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where humans still matter</h2>
<p>Humans decide what should run and review outputs when stakes are high.</p>

<h2>Who this is for (and not for)</h2>
<p>Best for uneven workloads. Not ideal for high-volume constant work.</p>

<p>If you want a second opinion, you can text PJ.</p>
