<h1>Pay-Per-Use vs Subscription AI</h1>

<p>Subscription AI charges continuously. Pay-per-use AI charges only when work runs.</p>

<h2>What problem this solves</h2>
<p>Many businesses pay monthly for tools they barely touch.</p>

<h2>How pay-per-use differs</h2>
<ul>
  <li>No ongoing fees</li>
  <li>Costs tied to actual jobs</li>
  <li>Easier to stop or change</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where humans stay involved</h2>
<p>Humans decide what runs and review outcomes.</p>

<h2>When pay-per-use makes sense</h2>
<p>Irregular or experimental workloads.</p>

<h2>When subscriptions make sense</h2>
<p>High-volume, constant usage.</p>
