<h1>San Diego Transportation Help & Options</h1>

<p>
SideGuy is not a transportation company. We help people in San Diego understand their options and make calm, informed decisions before spending money.
</p>

<h2>Common Transportation Situations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Airport rides and pickups</li>
  <li>Events, concerts, and venues</li>
  <li>One-off help or deliveries</li>
  <li>Ongoing or special needs transportation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Transportation Options Explained</h2>
<p>
San Diego transportation can mean rideshare, private drivers, shuttles, public transit, or simply asking for help. Each has tradeoffs depending on timing, location, and urgency.
</p>

<h2>Local Reality Matters</h2>
<p>
Traffic patterns, coastal vs inland distances, event congestion, and airport timing all change what makes sense. Generic advice usually fails here.
</p>

<h2>When It Helps to Talk to a Human</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Time-sensitive situations</li>
  <li>Confusing pricing or availability</li>
  <li>Special requirements</li>
  <li>You just want a straight answer</li>
</ul>

<h2>SideGuy’s Role</h2>
<p>
We don’t book rides or take commissions. We help you think clearly, avoid mistakes, and choose the right path.
</p>

<p><strong>Clarity before cost. Human-first, always.</strong></p>
