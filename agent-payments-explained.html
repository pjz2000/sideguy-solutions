<h1>Agent Payments Explained</h1>

<p>Agent payments describe a model where specific tasks are paid for only when they run and complete.</p>

<h2>What this usually means</h2>
<p>Work is broken into clear jobs with defined outcomes instead of open-ended billing.</p>

<h2>What happens next</h2>
<p>Most tasks complete normally. Occasionally a human review is needed. Rarely, work is stopped and adjusted.</p>

<h2>When a human gets involved</h2>
<p>Humans approve results, handle exceptions, and make judgment calls.</p>

<h2>When not to use this</h2>
<p>Constant, high-trust, or ambiguous work.</p>

<h2>Risks and limits</h2>
<p>Over-automation can remove accountability if humans are not involved.</p>
