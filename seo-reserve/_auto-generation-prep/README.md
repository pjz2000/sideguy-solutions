# SideGuy Auto-Generation Prep Layer

Purpose:
- Prepare content ideas safely
- Require explicit human approval
- Prevent premature automation

Doctrine:
- Preparation is not execution
- Approval is explicit, never implied
- Generation happens elsewhere, later

This layer feeds:
Reserve → Decision OS → (Future Generator)

Nothing here creates pages.
