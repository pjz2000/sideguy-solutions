# Venue Authority Rules

Doctrine:
- Venues are SPOKES, never HUBS
- Venue pages answer questions, not define strategy
- Decision gravity remains at:
  - /who-do-i-call/
  - /payments/
  - /ai-help/

Rules:
- No venue gets canonical priority
- No venue owns a topic
- No venue expands into listings or sales

Purpose:
Venues exist to intercept emotional decisions and slow them down.
