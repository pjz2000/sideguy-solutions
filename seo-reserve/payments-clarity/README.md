# SIDEGUY PAYMENTS CLARITY STACK (CANONICAL)



WHY THIS EXISTS

- Google is sending confused, high-intent traffic

- PPC confirms people want explanations, not pitches

- SideGuy wins by slowing decisions, not accelerating them



RULES

- Explain fees, delays, control

- No persuasion

- No savings promises

- No urgency

- Human clarity > automation



WHAT THIS STACK SUPPORTS

1. Stripe vs Instant Settlement (Reserve)

2. Payments Calculators (Reality-based)

3. Crypto Help Desk (Human-first)



STATUS

- SAFE

- APPEND-ONLY

- LOCKED UNTIL SIGNAL-DRIVEN RELEASE




PPC ALIGNMENT NOTES

- CTR proves clarity works

- Traffic spikes follow comparison-style queries

- Do NOT add pricing CTAs

- Do NOT push signups

- Route confused users to explanation + Text PJ



TEXT PJ IS THE CONVERSION

Not forms. Not funnels. Human resolution.
