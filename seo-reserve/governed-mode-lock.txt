SIDEGUY RESERVE — GOVERNED MODE LOCK

PURPOSE:
- Freeze doctrine
- Prevent overbuilding
- Protect long-term trust

NON-NEGOTIABLE TRUTHS:
- More pages ≠ more value
- Calm beats clever
- Trust compounds slower than traffic
- Humans are the product, not the pages

BUILD PERMISSION RULE:
A new page may exist ONLY IF:
- It answers a real, observed question
- It reduces future human explanation
- It fits an approved manifest
- It survives a 24-hour cool-off

HARD NO LIST:
Never build pages because:
- “SEO opportunity”
- “Competitor has it”
- “It feels cool”
- “We might need it later”

RATE LIMIT:
- Max: 1 page per 7 days
- Preferred: 1 page per 14 days
- Zero pages is a valid success state

HUMAN ESCAPE HATCH:
When unsure:
- Do not generate
- Route to Text PJ
- Let conversation teach the system

SUCCESS METRICS:
- Conversations get shorter
- Questions get better
- Pages feel inevitable, not forced
- You feel calm operating the system

END — THIS FILE IS THE BRAKE
