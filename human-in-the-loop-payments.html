<h1>Human-in-the-Loop Payments</h1>

<p>Automation executes tasks. Humans remain responsible.</p>

<h2>What this usually means</h2>
<p>Payments pause or route for review when needed.</p>

<h2>What happens next</h2>
<p>Most flows are automatic, with human checks on edge cases.</p>

<h2>When a human gets involved</h2>
<p>Disputes, exceptions, and judgment calls.</p>

<h2>When not to use this</h2>
<p>Fully discretionary decisions.</p>

<h2>Risks and limits</h2>
<p>Removing humans too early increases errors.</p>
