    <h1>AI FAQ (extended) — deeper answers for practitioners</h1>

    <p class="lede">Long-form FAQ and practical guidance covering common concerns from data quality to governance, tooling, and ROI for small teams.</p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Data quality & preparation</h2>
      <p>Good pilots depend on representative, clean samples. Expect a short data-prep phase: sampling, labeling, and building checks to filter noisy records.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Governance questions</h2>
      <p>Keep governance lightweight: name an owner, define a review cadence, and log decisions. Escalate to legal for regulated data.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Tooling & vendor selection</h2>
      <p>Compare tools by privacy, cost, and ease. Ask vendors for sample outputs and failure mode descriptions before committing.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Measuring ROI</h2>
      <p>Define simple metrics early (time saved, accuracy, revenue impact) and measure them at the pilot checkpoints to calculate payback.</p>
    </section>

      <h3>FAQ — extended</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>How much data is enough?</dt>
        <dd>It depends—some pilots need only hundreds of representative samples, others benefit from thousands; start with a small sample and iterate.</dd>

        <dt>What are good acceptance criteria?</dt>
        <dd>Set clear thresholds for accuracy or percent automated plus a measurement window to assess reliability.</dd>

        <dt>How do we keep audits and reviews simple?</dt>
        <dd>Collect a lightweight evidence pack: sample inputs/outputs, logs, and a short risk assessment for reviewers.</dd>
