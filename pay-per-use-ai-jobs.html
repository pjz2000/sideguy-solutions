<h1>Pay-Per-Use AI Jobs</h1>

<p>Pay-per-use AI jobs are tasks that only cost money when they actually run and complete. There are no monthly retainers and no ongoing fees if nothing happens.</p>

<h2>What problem this solves</h2>
<p>Many businesses pay for software they barely use. Pay-per-use jobs reduce waste by charging only when real work is done.</p>

<h2>How pay-per-use jobs usually work</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A specific task is defined</li>
  <li>The job runs only when triggered</li>
  <li>Payment happens after completion</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where humans still matter</h2>
<p>Humans define the task, review outcomes, and step in when judgment or accountability is required.</p>

<h2>Who this is for (and not for)</h2>
<p>This works best for irregular or outcome-based work. It is not ideal for constant daily operations or subjective decisions.</p>

<p>If you want a second opinion on whether this makes sense, you can text PJ.</p>
