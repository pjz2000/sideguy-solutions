<h1>Pay-Per-Use AI Jobs (Explained Simply)</h1>

<p>Pay-per-use AI jobs are small, on-demand tasks that run only when you need them. Instead of monthly subscriptions or retainers, you pay only when a specific job runs and completes.</p>

<h2>What problem this solves</h2>
<p>Many businesses pay for tools they rarely use. Pay-per-use jobs reduce waste by aligning cost directly with real work.</p>

<h2>How pay-per-use jobs work</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A task is triggered intentionally</li>
  <li>The job runs once, on demand</li>
  <li>Payment happens only after completion</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where humans still matter</h2>
<p>Automation handles repeatable steps. Humans provide judgment, context, and oversight when decisions matter.</p>
